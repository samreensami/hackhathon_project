# Introduction to Physical AI & Robotics

The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. 
This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to a massive demand for new skills.

We have already written a book on AI agents. Therefore, this course teaches Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. 

## Course Overview

This course will guide you through:

- Understanding the fundamentals of Physical AI.
- Learning humanoid robotics design and control.
- Integrating AI agents with physical robots.
- Hands-on projects and assignments to implement learned concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Describe key concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
2. Develop basic AI-driven robotic behaviors.
3. Interface AI software agents with humanoid robotic systems.
4. Apply theoretical knowledge in practical projects.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into multiple modules:

### Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI
- Basics of AI in the physical world.
- Differences between software AI and Physical AI.
- Examples and real-world applications.

### Module 2: Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals
- Overview of humanoid robots.
- Anatomy and mechanics of humanoid robots.
- Sensors, actuators, and control systems.

### Module 3: AI & Robotics Integration
- Connecting AI agents with robots.
- Programming behaviors and motion.
- Simulation and testing.

### Module 4: Projects and Applications
- Capstone project: build a simple AI-driven humanoid task.
- Case studies of advanced robotics applications.
- Ethics and future directions in AI robotics.

## Conclusion

This course prepares students to thrive in the era of AI-driven robotics, 
equipping them with skills to design, program, and deploy intelligent humanoid systems.
